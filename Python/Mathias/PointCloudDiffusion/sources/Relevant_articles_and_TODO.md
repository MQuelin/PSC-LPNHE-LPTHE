Proposed architechture derived from articles:

Hit encoding: PointNet and normalizing flow ?
Context encoding: ? (possibly a simple bijective mathematical function given context dimension of 4 ?)
Diffusion: Latent Unet architechture
Decoding: ? Point Net
Point classification (energy, time): PointNet
Error estimation through GAN VAE ? EPiC encoder
